# weather-app
A simple weather app üå§Ô∏è
<br></br>

**Notes:**
- Various different modules were approached in the making of this (seemingly simple) project, to the point where I almost massively overcomplicated matters with five different imports.
- WeatherAPI was chosen for its ease of use...I still hadn't a clue what was going on until I realised I'd finally have to face JSON.
- JSON seems to make more sense - I think I was being dramatic. However, admittedly, the only piece of JSON involved isn't even JSON: it's a Python Dictionary!
- I'm glad I found an absolutely _unjustifiable_ reason to implement geocoding into one of my projects. Truly, there is just no need for the location to be translated into co-ordinates other than for my own amusement.
- Possible extra feature could ask whether data should be in metric...though I'm not keen on the alternatives.
